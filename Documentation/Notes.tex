\section{Model Assumptions.}
In this section, we highlight the assumptions made in the model we are following. This is primarily to refer to in future when making our own adjustments to the model. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Only one antigen per Germinal Center. 

\end{itemize}


\section{Implementation Ideas}

Generate $N\times N\times N$ spatial grid to place discrete sphere with radius $N/2$ within. Find and store the valid spatial points within this grid. At each time step, record where the discrete grid spot is free or contains a cell. Use dictionary, return None if empty, otherwise cell ID? If we want to find the position of a cell, we would need to work the dictionary backwards, likely to be computationally slow. Could have two dictionaries - one that gives position from cell ID and another that gives Cell ID / None from position. Is this likely to cause update issues?

The model given assigns cells an ID based on their position of each cell in its respective type list. This would allow for multiple cells to have the same ID and would require ID and type to be uniquely identified. Rather give each cell a unique ID regardless of type so always identifiable from ID alone. 

Don't need to have dictionary storing whether a point is within the sphere, can just re-apply the same calculation used to find original sphere co-ordinates. 

Let the points on the surface of the sphere be the points which are missing a neighbour. Should be easy to check.

Algorithms state to randomly iterate through list. Currently doing it by shuffling list and iterating over. Since elements sometimes have to be deleted from these lists, would be better to randomly shuffle a list of indices so the element known to be deleted can be removed straight away. Can make the removal operation quicker by popping end of list and placing it in position of removed element. 

Algorithm 4, progress\_cycle has been implemented poorly. Instead of having a lot of if statements, could store the states in a list in order of how they transition. Then only have to store the index for each cell and when they progress, add one to that index opposed to using lots of if statements. 

The following was followed to generate random unit vectors for initial polarity: https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/77927/generate-random-unit-vectors-around-circle

The germinal center has a maximum size. We generate ID values from 0 to the maximum number of cells in the germinal center and store/track them in a list. We assign each new cell an ID number (from the end of the list, using pop() to ensure O(1) operation) and when a cell dies, we append its ID value back into the list. In a numpy array of fixed size, we will store the properties of each cell as a named tuple (Not using named tuples since we can not charge their properties, instead, we will use types.SimpleNamespace). To access the correct properties, the associated ID to a cell will be used as the index in the numpy array (Now using lists since numpy arrays can't store SimpleNamespace variables). Unassigned IDs will contain None values in numpy array (list) and when a cell gets removed from the simulation, the numpy array (list) index is converted back to being a None value. 

In main function, we have to iterate over lists randomly and occasionally remove elements from this list, can do so using enumerate function to track indices of what needs to be removed.

\subsection{General Parameters \& Tracked Lists}
\begin{itemize}

\item We keep two dictionaries, Grid\_id and Grid\_type. These dictionaries have a key of a tuple location within the sphere and return the cell and cell type located at that location, respectively. If that position is free, both dictionaries will contain 'None'.

\item Dictionaries CXCL12 and CXCL12 will stores the amount of each located at a given location. 

\item We will use StormaList, FDCList, CBList, and TCList to store the IDs of cells in each of these respective states. 

\end{itemize}
